/*
** (jws) revisions: 
** A prefix is a word in a dedicated wordlist (name stored in list_name below)
** that is searched in a special way by the prefix parse step. When a prefix
** matches the beginning of an incoming token, push the non-prefix part of the
** token back onto the input stream and execute the prefix code.
**
** The parse step is called ficlParsePrefix. 
** Storing prefix entries in the dictionary greatly simplifies
** the process of matching and dispatching prefixes, avoids the
** need to clean up a dynamically allocated prefix list when the system
** goes away, but still allows prefixes to be allocated at runtime.
