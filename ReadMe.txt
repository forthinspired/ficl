FICL 4.0.31
June 2003

________
OVERVIEW

Ficl is a complete programming language interpreter designed to be embedded
into other systems (including firmware based ones) as a command, macro,
and development prototype language.  Ficl stands for "Forth Inspired
Command Language".

For more information, please see the "doc" directory.
For release notes, please see "doc/releases.html".

____________
INSTALLATION

Ficl builds out-of-the-box on the following platforms:
	* Linux: use "Makefile.linux".
	* Win32: use "ficl.dsw" / "ficl.dsp".
To port to other platforms, we suggest you start with the Linux
makefile and the "unix.c" / "unix.h" platform-specific implementation
files.  (And please--feel free to submit your portability changes!)

(Note: Ficl used to build under RiscOS, but we broke everything
for the 4.0 release.  Please fix it and send us the diffs!)
